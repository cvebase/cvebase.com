Matt Graeber is a security researcher and a veteran Black Hat trainer. He is a regular speaker at security conferences discussing topics such as post-exploitation tradecraft, application whitelisting, code signing, and PowerShell. He has made a reputation for himself demonstrating how otherwise trusted software and technology can be abused by attackers – referred to as the "living off the land" methodology. Matt is very much fascinated by the concept of trust, what it means to people, and how assumptions of trust can be subverted.
