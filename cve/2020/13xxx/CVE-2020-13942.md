Apache Unomi allows remote attackers to send malicious requests with MVEL and OGNL expressions that could contain arbitrary classes, resulting in Remote Code Execution with the privileges of the running Unomi application. The severity of these vulnerabilities is heightened since they can be exploited through a public endpoint, which should be kept public by design for the application to function correctly, with no authentication, and no prior knowledge on the attacker’s part. This vulnerability has a score of 10.0 (Critical) since it leads to complete compromise of the Unomi service’s confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility, in addition to allowing access to the underlying OS.
