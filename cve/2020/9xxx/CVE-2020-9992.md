A design flaw in MobileDevice.framework/Xcode and iOS/iPadOS/tvOS Development Tools allows an attacker in the same network to gain remote code execution on an iOS/iPadOS/tvOS device. The SSL context is mistakenly dismissed after an actual SSL handshake is performed, disguising the connection as secure even while unencrypted. This leads to the Wi-Fi debugging becoming vulnerable to a MITM-attack. An attacker is able to hijack a running debug session and gain arbitrary code execution on the target device.

The PoC shared under project `c0ntextomy` demonstrates the vulnerability with a debug session hijack, remote code execution, and sensitive data exfiltration.
